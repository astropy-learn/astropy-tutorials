About
=====

The purpose of this repository is to collect tutorials and useful code snippets
for Astropy.

Note 
==== 

The structure of this repository is under heavy development!  Currently, the
tutorials are just placed in a tutorials directory and use reST syntax, but
eventually they will all be converted into IPython Notebook format.
