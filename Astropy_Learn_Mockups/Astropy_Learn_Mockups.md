I went through the org chart and tried to incorporate all the required features.
Following are the proposed mockups for Astropy Learn Website.

###Landing page with a dynamic search feature.

This is a low fidelity structure of the landing page. It has a search bar, filter column, link to learning material on placards and placards to inform  the user about the different types of learning materials.

###Defining different learning materials

Placards of different color can be used to inform the user about the different types of study materials (Documentation, tutorial, guides, and examples). These placards are placed on the landing page right below the search bar to ensure that the user takes note of these study materials and can easily refer to them whenever required. These placards are clickable and direct the user to the corresponding page which only has learning material of that particular category.

###Search Result

Following the same design theme the search results also are shown on different placards. These placards contain the following information:
    *Title
    *Description or  a short snippet of the text surrounding the search query
    *Thumbnail image
    *Tags
    *Color strip corresponding to the study material type for easy distinction.

###Responsiveness

The website will be completely responsive i.e. it will easily adapt to any screen size.
This mockup shows how the website will look on different screen sizes.
