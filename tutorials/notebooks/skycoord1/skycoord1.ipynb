    "*World coordinates* serve to locate a measurement in some multi-dimensional parameter space. A World Coordinate System (WCS) specifies the physical, or world, coordintes to be attached to each pixel or voxel of an N-dimensional image or array. For the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format, an [elaborate set of standards and conventions](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html) have been developed for the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format ([Wells et al. 1981](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981A&AS...44..363W/abstract)). A typical WCS example is to specify the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) on the sky associated with a given the pixel or spaxel location in a 2-dimensional celestial image ([Greisen & Calabretta 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A&A...395.1061G/abstract); [Calabretta and Greisen 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A&A...395.1077C/abstract)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`astropy.wcs` subpackage](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/) implements FITS standards and conventions for World Coordinate Systems. Using the `astropy.wcs.WCS` object and `matplotlib`, we can generate images of the sky that have axes labeled with coordinates such as right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec). This requires selecting the proper projections for `matplotlib` and providing a `WCSAxes` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to initialize a `WCSAxes` object: with a Python dictionary or with Python lists. This tutorial provides examples of both."

    "For example, we can initialize an `astropy.wcs.WCS` object with two axes. The axes are defined by `CTYPE` keywords. In this example, we define a two coordinate axes with units of degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a table detailing how each basic WCS keywords are for (where n is some integer): \n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRVALn**: the coordinate value at the reference point\n",
    "* **CRPIXn**: the array location of the reference point in pixels\n",
    "* **CDELTn**: the coordinate increment at the reference point \n",
    "* **CTYPEn**: the axis type (8 characters)\n",
    "* **CUNITn**: character-valued and overrides default units\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to define a particular WCS object for use in Astropy is to first construct a dictionary containing all the essential information mapping the pixel coordinate space to the world coordinate space. The advantage of this approach is that we can also specify the value for `NAXIS` for each axis, which is otherwise inaccessible via other means. \n",
